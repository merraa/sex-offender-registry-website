                    It’s helpful to learn the facts about healthy sexual development as well as child sexual abuse. First be sure you are comfortable talking about the topic. If you are comfortable using the words, your child will feel that and know that they can talk to you. A conversation like this doesn’t need to be a big “talk,” but can be something you address gradually. If you are relaxed and easy to talk to, you can be an approachable adult who your child can ask questions or voice any concerns.</p>

                    <p>It’s also helpful to know the typical behaviors for each stage of a child’s development. Know what the normal stages of development are for preschool, elementary, middle school children and young teens. Learn the signs of sexual abuse. It will be easier to identify normal behaviors and behaviors that might be of concern. Don’t wait until it is too late to learn the signs of sexual abuse.</p>

                    <p>Conversations with your child or teen should be open, casual and ongoing. As your child’s understanding of the world grows, conversations can also grow.
                    Discussions about sexuality and sexual abuse can start long before a child reaches puberty. The sooner a parent initiates conversations about healthy sexual development, how the body changes and sexual abuse, the better. Here some tips on starting the conversation.</p>
                    <p>- <b>Names for body parts:</b> Names for body parts: Properly naming and talking openly about body parts helps children gain respect for their bodies and the bodies of others. These conversations help children to not be ashamed or embarrassed by their bodies and prevent secrecy and silence. Teaching children names of body parts also gives them language to ask questions or talk to you about any worries and concerns.</p>
                    <p>- <b>Modern healthy boundaries</b> Teaching your child that it’s OK to say “no” to being  touched and to respect when someone tells them “no” lets them set and respect healthy boundaries. If it’s helpful, talk with other adults about boundaries and ask them to respect if a child says “no” to a hug or other physical affection. This sends a consistent message about respecting each other’s boundaries. And be sure to respect a child’s boundaries in play and in affection.</p>

                    FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SAFETY
                </button>

                   <p> One way to protect your children is to create a family safety plan. A safety plan gets everyone in the family on the same page and lets you begin important conversations about boundaries, healthy interactions and how to talk about changing expectations as children grow older. Here are some ideas to get started:
                   </p>

                   <p><b>Educate everyone in the family:</b> Make sure every adult knows about healthy sexual development in children and the warning signs of child sexual abuse. Teach children proper names for body parts so they are aware of their own bodies.</P>
                   <p><b>Start talking:</b> Talk with your children and teens and let them know you are open to questions. If you have used the words out loud, then they will be more comfortable coming to you with concerns.
                   <p><b>Set clear family boundaries:</b> Set clear family guidelines for personal privacy, respect, safety, healthy communications and behavior. Talk about them and model respect for these guidelines. Equally important are conversations about what to do when someone ignores or violates a guideline within or outside of the family. As a child grows older, boundaries and guidelines may need to change.</p>
                   <p><b>Get safe adults involved:</b> Identify people outside the family you can talk to if there’s a concern. Be sure no one in your family is isolated. However, if even if a close friend or relative seems too friendly or overly interested, ask more questions. They may not be safe to trust with your child.
                    Know your local resources: Learn about the agencies in your area and how to contact them. Consider making a list of resources for everyone to have.</p>
