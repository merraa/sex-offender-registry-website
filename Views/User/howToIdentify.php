            It’s important to identify the signs of sexual abuse and abusive behaviors, so that abuse can be stopped as soon as possible — or before anyone is harmed. Warning signs are often seen in concerning behaviors of children, teens and adults. Being able to recognize these behaviors can help you respond appropriately.

                <p>Warning signs may occur in children going through different kinds of trauma or difficult situations. Children and teens may display a wide variety of warning signs. Any one warning sign — or even several — may or may not mean a child has been sexually abused. If you notice behavioral warning signs, remain calm, gather more information, listen carefully and decide if you need help. If you recognize any physical indications, or if a child hints at or discloses sexual abuse, please call the police or child protective services and seek professional help immediately.</p>

                <b>WHAT IF YOU AREN’T SURE IF IT’S ABUSE?</b>
                <p>Know that you don’t have to face this alone. Sexual abuse thrives in isolation. Find someone you trust that you can talk with. Seek out resources available in your area to help educate yourself about child sexual abuse. As for what to learn, see this short list below:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Learn the warning signs:</b> It’s up to attentive adults to recognize signs and know what sexual abuse indicators children and teens display.</li>

                        <li><b>Get comfortable talking about this:</b> Often children/teens do not disclose what happened in the first conversation. Children/teens may even test an adult’s reaction before full disclosure. If you are calm, reassuring and comforting, the child/teen may feel comfortable enough to disclose. Sometimes victims of abuse take days, weeks, months or even years to disclose their abuse.</li>

                        <li><b>Understand healthy sexual development:</b> It’s also helpful to understand what healthy sexual development in children/teens looks like. It’s good to know what’s healthy for each age range, what might be concerning and when to call for help.</li>
                    <ul>

                    <p>Conversations with your child or teen should be open, casual and ongoing. As your child’s understanding of the world grows, conversations can also grow.
                    Discussions about sexuality and sexual abuse can start long before a child reaches puberty. The sooner a parent initiates conversations about healthy sexual development, how the body changes and sexual abuse, the better. Here some tips on starting the conversation.</p>
                    <p>- <b>Names for body parts:</b> Names for body parts: Properly naming and talking openly about body parts helps children gain respect for their bodies and the bodies of others. These conversations help children to not be ashamed or embarrassed by their bodies and prevent secrecy and silence. Teaching children names of body parts also gives them language to ask questions or talk to you about any worries and concerns.</p>
                    <p>- <b>Modern healthy boundaries</b> Teaching your child that it’s OK to say “no” to being  touched and to respect when someone tells them “no” lets them set and respect healthy boundaries. If it’s helpful, talk with other adults about boundaries and ask them to respect if a child says “no” to a hug or other physical affection. This sends a consistent message about respecting each other’s boundaries. And be sure to respect a child’s boundaries in play and in affection.</p>

                    It’s helpful to learn the facts about healthy sexual development as well as child sexual abuse. First be sure you are comfortable talking about the topic. If you are comfortable using the words, your child will feel that and know that they can talk to you. A conversation like this doesn’t need to be a big “talk,” but can be something you address gradually. If you are relaxed and easy to talk to, you can be an approachable adult who your child can ask questions or voice any concerns.</p>
